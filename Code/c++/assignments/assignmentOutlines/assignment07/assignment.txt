C++ Assignment 7 

Classes

1) Design and implement a class called Date that stores a date.  The member 
   functions should include:
   - A constructor that takes numbers for year, month and day
   - A default constructor sets the value to the current date
   - A toString() function that returns a human readable representation of the 
     date including the name of the month.
   - Getter functions for the year, month and day
   - isLeapYear() predicate as a member function;
   - isLeapYear(unsigned year) as a static member function
   - isLeapDay() as a predicate function. 
2) Write a short program to test the functionality of these member functions.

Points to look out for:

- How you implement the internals of this class is up to you.  There are several 
  approaches you could use. 
- Be sure to check for valid input on the constructor that takes the 
  year/month/date values. This includes leap years.  If your objects get an 
  invalid date value, simply write the results to the std::cerr object.  We will
  learn how to deal with errors like this later.
- To find the current date and some other idea on how to do this, rtfm on the 
  tm struct (which is a C thing).
- You are given a basic framework from which to work (Makefile, functions.cpp,
  test.cpp, prototypes.h).  Add any extra files you need to implement the 
  solution.
- You will find that representing month names might be easier if you use an
  array of const string objects (see the Critter Caretaker example).
