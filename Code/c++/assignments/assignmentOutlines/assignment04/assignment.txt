C++ Assignment 4 

Write a program that includes and tests the following functions:
1) int askForInt(const string& prompt, int high, int low);
   This function prompts the user with the string object that is passed into it 
   and returns the value that the user enters.  This function must handle any 
   sort of invalid entry from the user and be within the range described by the
   the values high and low.
2) bool isPrime(unsigned);
   This predicate returns true is the argument is a prime number (evenly 
   divisible only by itself and 1, false otherwise.
3) vector<unsigned> factors(unsigned);
   This function returns a vector of unsigned ints that is the set of
   prime numbers that are the factors of the number entered.
   Ex: factor(294) returns the vector [2, 3, 7, 7]

Write a program that is interactive in that it will continue to prompt the 
user to enter a new number to factor and display it until the user wants to quit.
