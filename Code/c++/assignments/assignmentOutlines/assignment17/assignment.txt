C++ Assignment 17

This will not require much of your time, though it may require you to run the sort demo overnight...or maybe more than one night
 
Run all seven sorts in the sort demo program with the following data set sizes:
 
50
100
150
200
250
300
400
500
750
1000
1250
1500
 
Run it with a time delay of 1 millisecond.
 
Record the time it took to perform the sort (as displayed above the graphic of 
the sort) and chart the times each sort took for each size of data set.
 
 
1) Chart the values in Microsoft Excel -- a line chart would be best.
2) Based on the times and time complexity of each algorithm, calculate the 
approximate times it will take for each sort to deal with the following data set 
sizes:
    - 10,000
    - 1,000,000
    - 100,000,000

Submission is the Excel spreadsheet.
