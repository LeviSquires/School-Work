C++ Assignment 5 

Adjust the program that implements and uses a recursive version of the fibonacci 
function to use an iterative version. We discussed that any function that uses
recursion can be rewritten using iteration.  Rewrite the fibonacci function to
be iterative. 

Note: only the function needs to be rewritten. 

Discuss the advantages and disadvatages of using recursion/or iteration.

Bonus: create appropriate Makefiles for this project.  (hint: they will be small)
