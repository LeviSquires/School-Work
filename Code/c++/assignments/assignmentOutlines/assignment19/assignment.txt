C++ Assignment 19

Consider how we add two numbers:
 987
1142
----
 
1) We line up two numbers so the units are on top of each other.
2) Starting at the least significant digit, we add the digits of the two numbers 
   and put the result underneath. 
 987
1142
----
   9
   
3) If the result of an addition is ten or greater, subtract ten
   and carry-over one to the next digit.    

 1
 987
1142
----
  29
  
4) We iterate until all digits have been added.

The start_files project includes the askForInt() function that prompts for two 
integers.  It includes a function showIntBits(), which shows the bit pattern for 
the int argument. 

Finish a C++ program that prompts the user for two integers and performs 
addition by applying the rules of addition and the bitwise operations to each 
binary digit.  Start from the least significant digits of the operands and
iterate to the most significant.

What you are doing is applying the same rules for addition that already exist inside a 
computer's CPU.

Hint: Make sure you fully understand what the function showIntBits() is doing 
and how it works.

Note: Assuming that a byte is 8 bits in size will lead to significant grade 
deductions
