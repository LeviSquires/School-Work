C++ Assignment 11

Write the pseudo-code for a Gauss Jordan Elimination on a matrix to solve a 
linear system.

Assume the following:
   - The determinant of the unaugmented, n X n matrix has been found to be not
     0, so the matrix is not singular.
   - The matrix you are performing this operation on is augnmented so the 
     dimensions are n X (n + 1)
     
Hints:
   - Make sure you understand the three operations of GJ Elimination.
   - Write individual functions for each of the three operations
   - Write any helper functions you might think are necessary.
   - Google is your friend.
   - Here are some videos that will explain further:

       I usually don't include Wikipedia as a reference, but for stuff like 
       this, it is actually not bad.  This page has a graphic representation 
       of solving a 3 x 3 system, several good examples and some useful links.
       Pay special attention to the section titled "Row Reduction"  
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations

       (applies GJ Elimination to invert a matrix -- a slighly different 
        operation but the procedure is the same)  
        
Bonus
We are assuming that the square matrices we start with are not singular, (the 
determinant is 0).  Write the pseudo-code to find the determinant of an n X n
matrix.

Hints:
    - If you need more information on this, Google (and Khan Academy) are your
      friends
    - Use the Cofactors and Minors approach for any matrix that is bigger than 
      a 2 X 2.
    - Recursion is also your friend.
