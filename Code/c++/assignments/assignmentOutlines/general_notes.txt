General Notes on Assignments.

1) There will be 20 assignments in C++.  Most of these will be programming, but some will be pseudo-code and one will be an analysis in Microsft Excel or the Open Office spreadsheet.

2) All submissions will be made through the Subversion server.  You have a 
directory on the server under:

https://svn.trioscollege.com/svn/triOS/trunk/London/cpp/students
or:
https://svn.trioscollege.com/svn/triOS/trunk/Kitchener/cpp/students


3) Make sure that you organize your subversion directory in a logical manner 
like:
Assignment01
Assignment02
Assignment03
...

4) Make sure you include a text file called readme.txt that explains: 
- How to build the example.
- Your pseudo-code
- What you accomplished in the assignment.
- What you didn't accomplish.

5)  Make sure that you include the following files
- all .cpp files
- all .h files
- the readme.txt
- the Makefile (if required)
- the project (.vcprojx) and solution (.sln) file (if the assignment uses the 
  Visual Studio environment)
- any other file as specified.

6) Do NOT include other files like *.obj, *.o, *.exe  Debug directory, Release directory, ipch 
directory or any of the dozens of that are produced by Visual Studio.
