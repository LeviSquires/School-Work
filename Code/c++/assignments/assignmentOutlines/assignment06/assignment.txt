C++ Assignment 6

Projects Book (the small one) Chapter 5, Project 4.  (pg 55-56)

Be sure to represent the deck that you manipulate as a vector of pointers to 
const string objects. The cards will be stored as a global array of constant
strings, but the manipulation of the cards needs to be through the vector of
pointers to those cards.  

Important considerations (in other words, not following these points will lead 
to grade deductions):
 
1) Be sure that your solution manipulates pointers to strings and not the   
   strings themselves.
2) You have to seed a random number generator.  Make sure you do.
3) Use the start files with the given make file(s).
4) The random_shuffle() function is your friend. 
5) Display the cards as 4 rows of 13 cards
6) Store your pointers in a vector, not an array like Dawson says.

Bonus
1) Use the RandGen class and hook it into random_shuffle().  The RandGen class
   is included in the Makefile for your convenience.
