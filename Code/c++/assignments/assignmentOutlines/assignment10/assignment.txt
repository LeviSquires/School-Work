C++ Assignment 10


This is an extension of the Date class we have been working on.

1) Given the source code in the start_files directory and the pseudo-code 
   supplied in Assignment08Answer.txt, complete the following functions:

- static bool isLeapDay(int day, int month, int year); 
    This predicate will return true if the date represented by the arguments is  
    a leapday, false otherwise.

- void addDay(bool forward);
    This function will change a date by one day: forward if the argument is true
    and backward if false.

- static int maxDay(int month, int year);
    This function will return the maximum day for the month and the year of the 
    arguments
        
- void addYears(int years);
    This function will add years to the date object.  If the argument is 
    negative, the modified date is before the function is called.
    
- void addMonths(int months);    
    This function will add months to the date object.  If the argument is 
    negative, the modified date is before the function is called.

- void addDays(int days);   
    This function will add days to the date object.  If the argument is 
    negative, the modified date is before the function is called.

The code in test.cpp will test to see if your work is correct.  Compiling and 
running the existing program will cause incorrect data to be displayed.

NOTE -- VERY IMPORTANT:  Only modify date.cpp and only the functions indicated.

2) Build a new Visual Studio 2010 project and solution for this assignment.

NOTE: Submit you source code, readme.txt, the .sln file and the .vcxproj file.
