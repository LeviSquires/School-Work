C++ Assignment 16

Based on the Matrix class we have fleshed out and the answer to assignment 10, 
implement the function GJElimination, that will perform a full Gauss Jordan 
elimination on the matrix.

Hint 1: Implement the functions as described in the accompanied pseudo-code. 
        Note: pseudo-code is not C++ but it needs to be translated to C++
Hint 2: Implement exception handling if the parameters to a function are 
        invalid.  Use an existing C++ exception class or derive from such a 
        class.  
Hint 3: Be sure to use fuzzyEqual(...) when testing for equality between
        doubles.
Hint 4: It would be a good thing to make sure that '-0.000000' shows up as 
        just '0.000000'.

Bonus:  Implement a function: double GetDeterminant()const that returns the 
        determinant of the matrix.  Use the cofactors and minors approach
        (recursion is your friend).
