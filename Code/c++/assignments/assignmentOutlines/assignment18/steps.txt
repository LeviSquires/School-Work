Steps to convert the string list class to a template class

1) Move all functions in the template classes from the .cpp files to the .h 
   files.  You can remove these .cpp files from the project.
2) In the Node class, declare it a template class and change the string data to 
   the token you have chosen to represent the type of data. Change all getters,
   setters and constructors that use strings (or references to strings or const
   strings) to the same token.  Do this in both the declaration and definitions
   for the class.
3) Declare the friend relationship as a template.
4) Declare each member function to be a template function.
5) In the List class, declare it as a template class and change any string,
   reference to string or const string to the token chosen to represent the
   class.
6) In the List class, change each instance of "Node" to a Node of the token 
   chosen to represent the data type for the list.
7) Declare each member function to be a template function.
8) Be sure to specify what data type the list represents when you declare and 
   use the template class.
