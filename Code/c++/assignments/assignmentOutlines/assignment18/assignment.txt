C++ Assignment 18 

1) Given the C++ class for an ordered binary tree which we developed in class, 
   convert this class to a class template.  The starting project is in the
   start_files directory.

2) Test the template by using the following code in the main function:


int main()
{

	RandGen rg;
	Tree<double> tree;
	for(unsigned i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
	{
		tree.Insert(rg.getNormalized());
	}

	std::cout << "Pre Order:\n";
	tree.PreOrder(std::cout);
	std::cout << "\nPost Order:\n";
	tree.PostOrder(std::cout);
	std::cout << "\nIn Order:\n";
	tree.InOrder(std::cout);
	std::cout << std::endl;


	return 0;
}

3) Given these three transversals on the same tree, draw the complete tree:
      Pre Order:
      57      41      8       31      56      61      70      66      78      88
      Post Order:
      31      8       56      41      66      88      78      70      61      57
      In Order:
      8       31      41      56      57      61      66      70      78      88

4) Implement a copy constructor and assignment operator in the Tree 
   template so objects are deep copied.  
   
   Hint: Implement a function: 
       void CloneChildren(const TreeNode* p); 
   in the TreeNode class that clones the left and right children of the TreeNode
   passed into the function, attaches the clone to the implied object then calls 
   itself recursively on its children.
