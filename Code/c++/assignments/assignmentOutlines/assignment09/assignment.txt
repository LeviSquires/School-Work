C++ Assignment 9

Using the list class we developed in class, make the following modifications:

1) Change the data to a std::string variable.
2) Make the return types for the data getters in both List and Node classes 
   references to const.  Make the arguments for the Node ctor and the List data 
   setters references to const.
3) Answer the question: Why did we do what we did in item 2)?
4) Implement a copy ctor and assignment operator with deep copy on both the List
   and Node classes so that using these function does not end up with an 
   inglorious crash.
5) Wrap your solution into a Visual Studio Solution/Project.  Make sure to submit 
   just the files requested   
   
Bonus:
Submit a working Unix Makefile. Watch your line endings.
