To run this program simply compile the assignment01.cpp file no other files are needed.

/*
layout a chart with a number, squared and cubed columns.
create a for loop that sets i to 0 and allows it to reach 10.
	for loop outputs the value of i, i*i and i*i*i.
create a while loop with a limit variable set to 10.
	run the same for loop output while i is less than or equal to 10.
create a do while loop following the same steps as the while loop.

I accomplished everything that was asked for including the bonus.

I chose to use a for loop for this project because it is a post test bound loop. 
This assures that the program will check to see if i is less then 10 before executing.
Since it is bound it only takes the 10 inputs set in the programs state.

Any of the other loops work just as well for this assignment.
I think the while loop is just as appropriate as the for loop 
since it also is a post check loop. However I think the do while loop 
is not exactly what we need since this program is best with a post check.


Well done.  With bonus:
